## Rules

- Try not to be a douchebag.
- Don't hack.
- Have fun!

## Survival World

Use `/warp survival` to teleport to the survival world spawn.

## Creative World

Use `/warp creative` to teleport to the creative world spawn.

## PVP World

Use `/warp pvp` to teleport to the PVP world.

## Homes

This server supports the use of "homes" that allow you to teleport to specific places throughout the server.

Use `/sethome` to create a home. You can set multiple homes but each needs a unique name. You can name a home by adding a space and a name when using the command (e.g., `/sethome fishingSpot`). The limit for homes is 5 per player.

`/home` is used to teleport to a home. If you have multiple homes, specify a home by adding a space and the name of the home (e.g., `/home fishingSpot`). Be aware that there is a 5 second delay and a 5 second cooldown when using this command. If you move during the delay, the teleport will cancel.

If you want to delete a home, use `/delhome`. If you have multiple homes, specify a home by adding a space and the name of the home (e.g., `/delhome fishingSpot`).
