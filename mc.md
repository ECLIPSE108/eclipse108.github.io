## Rules

- Try not to be a douchebag.
- Don't hack.
- Have fun!

## Survival World

Use `/warp survival` to teleport to the survival world spawn.

## Creative World

Use `/warp creative` to teleport to the creative world spawn.

## PVP World

Use `/warp pvp` to teleport to the PVP world.

## Homes

This server supports the use of "homes" that allow you to teleport to specific places throughout the server.

Use `/sethome` to create a home. You can set multiple homes but each needs a unique name. You can name a home by adding a space and a name when using the command (e.g., `/sethome fishingSpot`). The limit for homes is 5 per player.

To teleport to a home, use `/home`. If you have multiple homes, specify a home by adding a space and the name of the home (e.g., `/home fishingSpot`). Be aware that there is a 5 second delay and a 5 second cooldown when using this command. If you move during the delay, the teleport will cancel.

If you want to delete a home, use `/delhome`. If you have multiple homes, specify a home by adding a space and the name of the home (e.g., `/delhome fishingSpot`).

`/homes` can be used to see a list of your homes.

## TPA

Teleport to players and teleport them to you (with their permission of course).

To request a teleport to a player, use `/tpa <player>` where `<player>` is the name of the player you want to teleport to.

To request a player to teleport to you, use `/tpahere <player>` where `<player>` is the name of the player you want to be teleported to you.

Use `/tpacancel` to cancel an outgoing teleport request.

Use `/tpaccept` to accept a teleport request being made out to you.

Use `/tpadeny` to deny a teleport request being made out to you.

## Hats

Put any block or item on your head using `/hat` while holding that item.
