  gametitle: Untitled Destruction Game

This project started in early May and was initially planned to be a Little Big Planet inspired bomb survival game. Quickly, plans shifted to turn it into a team deathmatch, tower defense kind of thing. 

At this period, development was strong as hell. Within a month, the core destruction system was pretty much finished. Explosions, craters, and bits and pieces of blown-up objects are all synced over the network with this system. The focus was then shifted to developing gameplay mechanics. Health, name tags, and team-based spawning were added. However, some personal events ultimately made me lose motivation to work on the game. 

No updates have been made in a while, and recently, my attention has shifted to the frick! meteors! rewrite. I'm certain I'll pick it back up again sometime, but for right now it's indefinitely on hold.
