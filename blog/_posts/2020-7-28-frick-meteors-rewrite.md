frick! meteors! is getting a complete rewrite!

The game is almost 2 years old as of writing this and has not been updated(properly) in over a year. I'm kinda disappointed with its current state yet working on it is a pain. Being my first project, the whole thing is riddled with un-commented spaghetti code. I could just leave it to rot and move on but I could never forgive myself. So I'm rewriting it from scratch ðŸ˜…. I'm planning on reworking the visual style and changing some gameplay elements. 

This rework will be the last proper update for the game. For real this time. Unless it turns out to be fun. Who knows.
